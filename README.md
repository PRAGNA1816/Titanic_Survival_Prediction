Titanic Survival Prediction
The Titanic dataset is a classic problem in machine learning, where the goal is to predict the survival of passengers based on various characteristics such as age, sex, class, and others. The dataset contains information about the 891 passengers who boarded the Titanic, including their demographics, ticket information, and survival status.

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the survival of passengers based on the available features. This project aims to explore the importance of different features in predicting survival and to evaluate the performance of various machine learning algorithms on this task.

Using the Titanic dataset, I developed a model that can predict the survival of passengers based on their characteristics. This dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks and provides a challenging problem for machine learning practitioners.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which contains the following features:

PassengerId (unique identifier)
Survived (0 = did not survive, 1 = survived)
Pclass (ticket class: 1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
Name
Sex
Age
SibSp (number of siblings/spouses aboard)
Parch (number of parents/children aboard)
Ticket
Fare
Cabin
Embarked (port of embarkation: C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Model
The model developed in this project uses Random Forest Classifier. The model is trained on the Titanic dataset and evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results
The results of the project are presented using accuracy score,confusion matrix and classification report. The model's performance is evaluated on a test set and the results are compared with baseline models.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict the survival of passengers in the Titanic dataset. The results show that the model achieves a high accuracy. This project provides a starting point for further exploration of the Titanic dataset and the development of more advanced machine learning models.'''
